# Project Name

This project is designed to explain JavaScript methods in great detail through TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

- git clone git@github.com:hopeVaughn/unpacking_methods_ts.git

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal using the `cd` command.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

- npm install

## Running TypeScript Files

You can use the `npm start` command to run TypeScript files in your terminal and display their output.

To use this command, run the following command in your terminal:

- npm start

This will run the file indicated in the index.ts file. You can change the file that is run by changing the import statement in the index.ts file.

## How to change the file that is run

To change the file that is run, you will need to change the import statement in the index.ts file.

The import statement should look like this:
`import { functionName } from './path/to/file';`

Then you will need to add function name to the console.log statement in the index.ts file.

The console.log statement should look like this:
`console.log(functionName);`

This should transpile and run the TypeScript code in the specified file, displaying the output in the terminal.
