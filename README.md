# Project Name

This project is designed to explain JavaScript methods in great detail through TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

- git clone git@github.com:hopeVaughn/unpacking_methods_ts.git

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal using the `cd` command.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

- npm install

## Running TypeScript Files

You can use the `npm run` command to run TypeScript files in your terminal and display their output.

To use this command, run the following command in your terminal:

- npm run <file-name>

Replace `<file-name>` with the name of the TypeScript file you want to run. You can specify the path to the file relative to the project root directory if it is in a folder. For example, if you have a file named `example.ts` in a folder called `src`, you can run it with the command `npm run src/example`.

This should transpile and run the TypeScript code in the specified file, displaying the output in the terminal.
